## ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥This is our project for OUC and Heriot Watt course IRP2

 Our project is a automatic ping pang ball pick up robot based on DJI EP robot and Elephant Arm

The main function is the detect.py in yolo_utils and the movement logic is in botMove.py

If you use our code, please star our repo.

## Introduction
Make sure your group has ```2 PC devices```, one for connecting DJI robot and the other one for connecting elephant arm through **SSH** or **VNC**
### DJI device
We have upload the pretrained model checkpoint for recognising ping pang ball, please revise the checkpoint path in ```detect.py``` then your DJI robot could recognise ping pang ball and move.
For distance judjing, there is a threshold value for detecting the square of the yolo box, maybe you need to adjust this value for your device.

### Elephant Arm device
Start ```video.py``` file as long as another device programms run, the robot arm camera will check whether there is a ball in its view through cv2 method.
